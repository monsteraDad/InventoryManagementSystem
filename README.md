# InventoryManagementSystem
Small business inventory management system built using scene builder and java 11. 

This was my first major project in my B.S. CS program.  

The brief was to make an Inventory management system for a small mom and pop shop that serviced bikes as well as sold bike parts. 
This project had many learning experiences, espescially learning the javafx library to implement communication between screens and buttons, learning 
search algorithms, data storage and transfer, as well as the use of arrays as dta structures in desktop applications 

I want to show case this as an example of everyone starting somewhere in their coding journey and an encouragement to myself
and my journey with code. with that being said this program could definitly use some TLC, so in the joys of self growth and learning,
if I were to do this project again. I would make the code less redundent, increase the GUI aethetics, and attach it to a 
database/API so the memory would have the benefits of Non-volitile memory. 


Thanks for stoping by!
