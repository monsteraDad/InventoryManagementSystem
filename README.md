# InventoryManagementSystem
Small business inventory management system built using scene builder and java 11. 

This was my first major project in my B.S. CS program.  

I want to show case this as an example of everyone starting somewhere in their coding journey and an encouragement to myself
and my journey with code. with that being said this program could definitly use some TLC, so in the joys of self growth and learning,
if I were to do this project again. I would make the code less redundent, increase the GUI aethetics, and attach it to a 
database/API so the memory would have the benefits of Non-volitile memory. 


Thanks for stoping by!
